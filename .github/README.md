I've chosen https://woodlandgardens.ca/ 

The websites most important aspect is its aesthetics; it's targetted towards people who enjoy gardening or beautiful things and thus should ideally have a beautiful website. It should make visitors think "Wow, I'd love to visit that place" but because of the websites lacking layout, it fails to do so.

The gallery is also a little bit over categorized if that makes sense? There are multiple groupings for the same images that you can browse, which feels unnecessary.

There should also be a way to get back to the original website through the gallery, but I'm having trouble doing so.

How does it look and feel?

It does do a good job at looking nature-esque with its usage of green colors, but it doesn't feel nature-esque. The colors should blend into eachother more naturally & feel warmer. Maybe through the use of a box shadow?

Here are two homepages that I feel this website could take inspiration from for improvement.

First up, ncx.com. This website is absolutely beautiful; with a good color-blend & its video that showcases several beautiful aspects of nature at once.

Secondly, wcs.com. Same deal as the last one, but it has a much more compact & easy to access styling.

As for colors, I feel like the current colour usage is a bit overwhelming; it's solely green, but I think it'd benefit from a slight usage of white or black to create some contrast.

Three colors would be green, white, black.

The website has a lot of images, but they're a bit hard to find due to their size. I think there should be some large images on the homepage—perhaps even one as a background image for the website.

As for fonts, I'd recommend cantora-one and host grotek. They're easy to read & have a sort of beauty to them.

P.S I've reconfigured this readme from my first submission after some you shared some insights for the site in class, such as  advising that I don't remake the gallery section (hope that's okay)

The images should be right up in your face from the get-go or at least some subset of images should be.

They should also have more engaging titles—titles such as "Water Features" don't necessarily make me want to click and scroll on the images.

I'd reduce the number of groupings for the images—e.g I'd have the images be viewable in large when you first click on the page and allow you to categorize & search them with the present albums button above. There's no need to have multiple grouping options when they all do the same thing.
