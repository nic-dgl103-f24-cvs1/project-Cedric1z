I've chosen https://woodlandgardens.ca/ 

The websites most important aspect is its aesthetics; it's targetted towards people who enjoy gardening or beautiful things and thus should ideally have a beautiful website. It should make visitors think "Wow, I'd love to visit that place" but because of the websites lacking layout, it fails to do so.

The gallery is also a little bit over categorized if that makes sense? There are multiple groupings for the same images that you can browse, which feels unnecessary.

There should also be a way to get back to the original website through the gallery, but I'm having trouble doing so.

How does it look and feel?

It does do a good job at looking nature-esque with its usage of green colors, but it doesn't feel nature-esque. The colors should blend into eachother more naturally & feel warmer. Maybe through the use of a box shadow?

Here are two homepages that I feel this website could take inspiration from for improvement.

First up, ncx.com. This website is absolutely beautiful; with a good color-blend & its video that showcases several beautiful aspects of nature at once.

Secondly, wcs.com. Same deal as the last one, but it has a much more compact & easy to access styling.

As for colors, I feel like the current colour usage is a bit overwhelming; it's solely green, but I think it'd benefit from a slight usage of white or black to create some contrast.

Three colors would be green, white, black.

The website has a lot of images, but they're a bit hard to find due to their size. I think there should be some large images on the homepage—perhaps even one as a background image for the website.

As for fonts, I'd recommend cantora-one and host grotek. They're easy to read & have a sort of beauty to them.

P.S I've reconfigured this readme from my first submission after some you shared some insights for the site in class, such as  advising that I don't remake the gallery section (hope that's okay)
