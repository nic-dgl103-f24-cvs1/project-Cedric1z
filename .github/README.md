I've chosen https://woodlandgardens.ca/ 

The websites most important aspect is its aesthetics; it's targetted towards people who enjoy gardening or beautiful things and thus should ideally have a beautiful website. It should make visitors think "Wow, I'd love to visit that place" but because of the websites lacking layout, it fails to do so.

The current website isn't appropriate because it's clunky & has poor color choice,

How does it look and feel?

It does do a good job at looking nature-esque with its usage of green colors, but it doesn't feel nature-esque. The colors should blend into eachother more naturally & feel warmer. Maybe through the use of a box shadow?

Here are two homepages that I feel this website could take inspiration from for improvement.

First up, ncx.com. This website is absolutely beautiful; with a good color-blend & its video that showcases several beautiful aspects of nature at once.

Secondly, wcs.com. Same deal as the last one, but it has a much more compact & easy to access styling.

As for colors, I feel like the current colour usage is a bit overwhelming; it's solely green, but I think it'd benefit from a slight usage of white or black to create some contrast.

Three colors would be green, white, black
